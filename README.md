# Breast Cancer Predictor using K-nearest Neighbour Classifier
A K-nearest neighbour classifier in Python from scratch.

Based on the Wisconsin breast cancer data, I created a K-nearest neighbour classifier in Python, resulting in an ~97% accuracy. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic). 

Please provide feedback since I am new to programming/data science.
